# DistIN - Distributed Identity Information Network

The concept for a Distributed Identity Information Network (DistIN) is based on a web-based protocol that can be implemented in existing web applications, but will also be provided as a standalone reference implementation including installation instructions at a later point in time, so that a fully functional application can be set up and used.

For implementation view the protocol documentation that explanes the required HTTP(S) actions that have to be implemented into a web application that is intended to support the DistIN protocol.
